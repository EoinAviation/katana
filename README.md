# katana
Just a side-project I'm using to teach myself about how programming languages come together

# Goals
- C# **inspired** syntax, sprinkled with some of the cool bits from some newer languages
- Write once, run anywhere, **without** a CLR (like .NET) or VM (like Java)
- Close to C++ levels of performance
- Easy debugging and error handling
- Native package manager
- .NET style project structure
- Multiple use cases:
  - Console apps
  - Static and Dynamic Libraries
  - Console applications
  - Daemons and Services
  - Games
  - GUI applications with 
    - Desktop and mobile support
    - Look and feel consistent with the host OS (Fluent for Windows, Material for Android, etc.)
    - Options for declarative UI like Swift and Flutter, or XML based like WPF and HTML
